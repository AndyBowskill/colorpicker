Neovera Color Picker
====================

Background
----------

A color picker is the most conspicuously absent component in the collection of built-in controls provided by Apple in the iOS library. There are many open-source components that have sprung up to fill the gap. This component was created for the [ToonThat][https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toonthat/id584478951?ls=1&mt=8] application as we didn't find the level of flexibility and feature-set in the others.
