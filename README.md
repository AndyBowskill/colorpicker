====================

Background
----------

A color picker is the most conspicuously absent component in the collection of built-in controls provided by Apple in the iOS library. There are many open-source components that have sprung up to fill the gap. This component was created for the [ToonThat][http://store.itunes.com] application as we didn't find the level of flexibility and feature-set in the others.
